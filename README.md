# OUR FINAL PROJECT - CODE WILL BE WRITTEN HERE - FOR DEPLOYMENT
### Create a branch for your task and make sure to delete after being merged.

# ⚠️
Make sure to checkout your branch first before you start writing.
Example: `git checkout yourbranchname`
when you're done, merge it into main
Example: `git merge main`
Then `git push origin main`

> Make sure you commit your code to your created branch first before you do the merging. Ok.

\ Enjoy coding... \
